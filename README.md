# information system of pakistani classical play (Implemented in java)

You have to design a basic information system to archive Pakistani classical old videos from
the past to connect and show the past to our younger generation. The goal of this assignment
is to add basic search facilities. The main focus is to implement Levenshtein Edit Distance to
consider dramas that might have been wrongly typed. A large collection of Urdu text is
written in English alphabets. For example, over internet there are many pages where Urdu is
written in English alphabets. There is a slight possibility that a user might mistype a word of
Urdu written in English when your search engine is built on such words. In short, as a
consequence, a user might write the same word in different forms. For example, in the
context of this assignment, (اجاال اندھیرا) is a popular classical old drama and can be written in
many forms like andhera ujhala, andera ujhala, undera ujala and many other forms. All of
these possible query terms should be mapped to the instance of this drama. For this
Levenshtein Edit Distance is used to find distance between these forms and then based on
some cutoff factor, all different forms should be matched to the drama instance term.<br/><br/>

This information system provides archiving of classic old dramas in different categories:
comedy, drama serial, telefilms and others. Basic search facilities should be provided. Basic
search facilities include:<br/><br/>

 Search by year<br/>
 Search by Actor<br/>
 Search by Producer<br/>
 Search by Director<br/>
 Search by Writer<br/>
 Search by Drama Name<br/><br/>

These search facilities should also be given as tags in each video files. Click on each tag
should open a list of corresponding videos. The detail of this assignment will be discussed in
class.
